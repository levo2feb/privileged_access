# Azure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) 

This project demonstrates a complete implementation of **Azure Privileged Identity Management (PIM)** to manage, control, and monitor access within Azure Active Directory (AAD). It follows Microsoft's recommended security practices for Just-In-Time (JIT) access, role assignments, audit logging, and break-glass account strategies.


## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository covers:

1. Overview and setup prerequisites for roles and licenses
2. Exploring Just-In-Time (JIT) access
3. Configuring Azure roles in PIM
4. Configuring Azure resources in PIM
5. Creating and configuring Privileged Access groups
6. Setting up PIM request and approval workflows
7. Analyzing PIM audit history and reports
8. Creating and managing break-glass accounts
